# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for XeroPulse, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

Based on the unified PRD requirements, this is a greenfield business intelligence platform that will be built from scratch using modern fullstack patterns. No existing starter templates are being used, allowing for complete architectural flexibility optimized for the specific requirements of financial data processing and conversational analytics.

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-10-22 | 1.0 | Initial fullstack architecture based on unified PRD (Next.js + AG-UI + CopilotKit + PydanticAI + Supabase + n8n + Metabase) | Winston (Architect) |

**Detailed Rationale:**

**Trade-offs and Key Decisions:**
- **Unified Document Approach**: Chose to combine frontend and backend architecture in a single document rather than separate documents to reduce context switching for AI agents and ensure integration points are clearly defined
- **Greenfield Architecture**: No existing starter templates constrains us, allowing optimal technology selection based purely on PRD requirements
- **AI-Driven Development Focus**: Structure and content optimized for AI agents that need clear, unambiguous technical guidance

**Key Assumptions:**
- Development team will use AI agents for implementation, requiring explicit architectural guidance
- Modern fullstack patterns (API-first, component-based) are preferred over traditional separated architectures
- Integration complexity between n8n, Metabase, and conversational AI requires careful architectural planning

**Areas Needing Validation:**
- Confirm greenfield approach vs. any existing codebase that should be incorporated
- Validate that unified document approach serves your development workflow better than separated documents

Perfect! I see you have an excellent front-end specification document that I can reference. Let me proceed to the next section - **High Level Architecture**.
