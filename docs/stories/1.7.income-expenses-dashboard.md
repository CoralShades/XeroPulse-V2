# Story 1.7: Build Income vs Expenses Dashboard (Dashboard 1)

## Status
**Draft**

## Story
**As a** finance team member,
**I want** an interactive dashboard showing cash flow with income and expense trends,
**So that** I can monitor weekly financial performance and 8-week rolling averages.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Metabase dashboard created with title "Income vs Expenses"
2. Chart 1: Weekly income trend line (source: Xero Payments API, filtered for invoice payments received)
3. Chart 2: Weekly expenses trend line (source: Xero Payments API, filtered for bill payments made)
4. Chart 3: 52-week rolling average calculation for wages expense displayed as 8-week view (source: Xero Profit & Loss Report, account code 500)
5. Chart 4: 52-week rolling average for general expenses displayed as 8-week view (source: Xero Profit & Loss Report, COS + Operating Expenses)
6. Date range filter widget (default: last 6 months, user-adjustable)
7. KPI cards displaying: Total Income (current period), Total Expenses (current period), Net Cash Flow (Income - Expenses)
8. Dashboard loads in <3 seconds with 6 months of data
9. Visual design: Clean layout, color-coded income (green) vs expenses (red), clear labels and legends
10. "Last updated" timestamp displayed prominently (sourced from `last_sync_at` metadata)
11. Dashboard exported to version control (`/supabase/dashboards/dashboard-1-income-expenses.json`)

## Dev Notes

### Dashboard Requirements

**Chart Specifications:**
- Income trend: Line chart, X-axis: Week, Y-axis: Income (AUD)
- Expenses trend: Line chart, X-axis: Week, Y-axis: Expenses (AUD)
- Rolling averages: Line charts with 8-week window

### SQL Query Examples

**Note**: Complete transformation logic, Power Query formulas, and n8n implementation patterns are documented in `docs/xero-api-endpoint-mapping.md#dashboard-1-income-vs-expenses`.

**Weekly Income (Blue Bars):**
```sql
-- Source: Xero Payments API filtered for ACCRECPAYMENT
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('week', payment_date) AS week,
  SUM(amount) AS total_income
FROM payments
WHERE
  organization_id = {{org_id}}
  AND payment_date >= {{start_date}}
  AND payment_date <= {{end_date}}
  AND payment_type = 'ACCRECPAYMENT'
  AND status = 'AUTHORISED'
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;
```

**52-Week Rolling Average for Wages (Yellow Line):**
```sql
-- Source: Xero Profit & Loss Report, Account Code 500 (Wages and Salaries)
-- Note: Dashboard displays 8-week view but calculation uses 52-week window
WITH weekly_wages AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', transaction_date) AS week_date,
    SUM(amount) AS weekly_amount
  FROM financial_data
  WHERE
    organization_id = {{org_id}}
    AND account_code = '500'  -- Wages and Salaries
    AND transaction_date >= {{start_date}} - INTERVAL '51 weeks'
  GROUP BY week_date
)
SELECT
  week_date AS current_week,
  weekly_amount,
  AVG(weekly_amount) OVER (
    ORDER BY week_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 51 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS rolling_52wk_avg
FROM weekly_wages
WHERE week_date >= {{start_date}}
ORDER BY week_date;
```

**Power Query Formula (from original dashboard):**
```
Custom1 = Table.AddColumn(
    Table.Sort(#"Grouped Rows", {{"ToDate", Order.Ascending}}),
    "52-Week Moving Avg",
    (currentRow) =>
        let
            currentDate = currentRow[ToDate],
            pastRows = Table.SelectRows(#"Grouped Rows",
                (r) => r[ToDate] <= currentDate and r[ToDate] > Date.AddDays(currentDate, -7*51)),
            avg = List.Average(pastRows[Amount])
        in avg
)
```

**52-Week Rolling Average for General Expenses (Gray Line):**
```sql
-- Source: Xero Profit & Loss Report (Total COS + Total Operating Expenses)
WITH weekly_expenses AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', transaction_date) AS week_date,
    SUM(amount) AS weekly_amount
  FROM financial_data
  WHERE
    organization_id = {{org_id}}
    AND (
      account_category = 'cost_of_sales'
      OR account_category = 'operating_expense'
    )
    AND transaction_date >= {{start_date}} - INTERVAL '51 weeks'
  GROUP BY week_date
)
SELECT
  week_date AS current_week,
  weekly_amount,
  AVG(weekly_amount) OVER (
    ORDER BY week_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 51 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS rolling_52wk_avg
FROM weekly_expenses
WHERE week_date >= {{start_date}}
ORDER BY week_date;
```

### Performance Optimization

- Index on `(organization_id, payment_date)` already exists
- Use Metabase query caching (15-minute TTL)
- Limit initial date range to 6 months
- [Source: database-schema.md#performance-indexes]

### Testing

**Test Execution:**
1. Load dashboard with test data
2. Verify all charts render
3. Test date filter functionality
4. Measure load time (<3 seconds)
5. Test export/import from JSON
