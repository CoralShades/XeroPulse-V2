# Epic Sequencing Strategy

**Phase 1 (MVP Core - 8-10 weeks):**

- Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure (3 weeks)
- Epic 2: Xero Integration & ETL Pipeline (3 weeks)
- Epic 3: Metabase Integration & Core Dashboards (2-4 weeks)

**Phase 2 (Enhanced Capabilities - 4-6 weeks):**

- Epic 4: Conversational AI Integration (4-6 weeks, parallel development)

**Phase 3 (Advanced Features - 6-8 weeks):**

- Epic 5: Advanced Analytics & Workflow Max Integration (4-6 weeks)
- Epic 6: Platform Optimization & Advanced Features (2-4 weeks)

**Risk Mitigation Notes:**

- Epic 4 (AI Integration) is designed as NFR to avoid blocking core BI functionality
- Epic 5 has external dependency on Workflow Max V2 API availability
- Parallel development tracks enable faster delivery of core value while building advanced features
